## General Info
This is my first every completed project which I'm really proud of. I wanted to make this as simple as it could with an amazing flow towards the end of the page. 


## Technologies Used
ReactJS 18.1.0 - a front-end Javascript library used for building user interfaces for single-page applications

tsParticles - a Javscript library which allows user to create a highly customizable Javascript particle effects, confetti explosions, and fireworks animations which are mostly used as backgrounds.

SASS - an extension of CSS which gives you more power than CSS allows and to help user to clean code easily


## Feature
-Who doesn't love dark mode nowadays? You can switch into dark mode by clicking on the switch on navigation bar on the far right
-Background particle color switches two as you switch into dark mode!
-Each section flows nicely with framer-motion transition effects
